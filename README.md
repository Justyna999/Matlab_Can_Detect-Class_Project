# Can Detection and Classification Program

This program uses MATLAB to perform image processing on a set of pictures to detect and classify cans as either open or closed. The program reads in a series of image files, applies various image processing techniques, and then determines whether each can is open or closed based on its Euler number.

## Requirements
To run this program, you will need:

MATLAB R2019a or later
Image Processing Toolbox

## Usage
To use the program, follow these steps:

Open MATLAB and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.
Edit the p variable in the code to the number of pictures you want to analyze.
Place the pictures you want to analyze in the same directory as the program.
Run the program by typing can_detection in the MATLAB command window.
The program will generate a series of output images and display the number of open and closed cans detected in each picture.
